Hey there! I'm Alejandro Piad Morffis, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with you.

First things first, I live in the vibrant city of Havana, Cuba üá®üá∫!

I recently achieved a huge milestone by completing my PhD in Computer Science, specializing in NLP and knowledge discovery. I'm passionate about both teaching and researching, and I'm lucky enough to do both at the University of Havana. My areas of expertise include Programming, Compilers, and AI, among other topics. I'm also heavily involved in researching the intersection of artificial intelligence and human languages, as well as exploring ways to democratize machine learning tools.

When I'm not busy with teaching and research, I enjoy spending my free time coding (especially in Python), playing video games (although I haven't had as much time for this lately), and writing. You can check out some of my work at my [Substack page](https://apiad.substack.com).

I'm always looking to connect with others who share my interests, so please don't hesitate to reach out! You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alepiad) and [Telegram](https://t.me/apiadnet).

**And these are the values I stand for:**

‚ù§Ô∏è I believe that people are generally good, and if given the chance, they will show the better parts of themselves.

‚ù§Ô∏è I believe people should have the chance to speak their minds, without fear to be silenced or hated for it, even if they are wrong. And they should have the option to honestly recognize their mistakes, learn from them, and be forgiven.

‚ù§Ô∏è I do not tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind, towards me or others around me, and I work very hard to apply those same standards to myself.

‚ù§Ô∏è I'm dedicated to education because I think that access to high-quality, unbiased, and free education is one of the best gifts anyone can receive, and one of the easiest ways to make people more reasonable and tolerant.

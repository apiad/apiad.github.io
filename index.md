My name is 👨Alejandro Piad Morffis. Here are some things about me:

I live in Havana, 🇨🇺Cuba.

I recently finished a 🎓PhD in Computer Science in the domain of NLP and knowledge discovery.

My two passions are 📚[teaching](https://apiad.net/about/teaching) and ⚗️[researching](https://apiad.net/about/research). I teach Programming, Compilers, AI, and a bunch of other stuff at the University of Havana. I also do research there, mostly on how to use artificial intelligence to better understand human languages, and on the democratization of machine learning tools.

In my free time, I also enjoy 💻[coding](https://apiad.net/about/projects) (mostly in 🐍Python), 🎮playing video games (sadly not much lately), and ✏️[writing](https://apiad.net/about/writing).

You can find me online on 🗨️[Twitter](https://apiad.net/at/twitter) and 📱[Telegram](https://apiad.net/at/telegram).

💌 The best way to contact me is to mention [**@AlejandroPiad**](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hey%20@AlejandroPiad%20...) on Twitter. I follow very few people (only those with whom I interact frequently) but I try to reply whenever someone asks me to.

**And these are the values I stand for:**

❤️ I believe that people are generally good, and if given the chance, they will show the better parts of themselves.

❤️ I believe people should have the chance to speak their minds, without fear to be silenced or hated for it, even if they are wrong. And they should have the option to honestly recognize their mistakes, learn from them, and be forgiven.

❤️ I do not tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind, towards me or others around me, and I work very hard to apply those same standards to myself.

❤️ I'm dedicated to education because I think that access to high-quality, unbiased, and free education is one of the best gifts anyone can receive, and one of the easiest ways to make people more reasonable and tolerant.
